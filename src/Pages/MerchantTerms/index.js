            DISPUTES
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any Wazodeal Service, or to any products or services sold or distributed by Wazodeal or through Wazodeal.com will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration and conciliation Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.
            <br></br>

There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Conditions of Use as a court would.
<br></br>

To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered Legal team at SAMUEL OLAGUNJU AND CO. SOLICITORS AND ADVOCATES, KILO-MASHA AREA, SURULERE, LAGOS. The arbitration will be conducted by Federal arbitration and conciliation agencies in Nigeria. Arbitration in Nigeria is governed by the Arbitration and Conciliation Act (Chapter 18, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004) (the “ACA”), which incorporates the 1985 UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (“UNCITRAL Model . Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the Federal arbitration and conciliation agencies . We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than  #75,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, Wazodeal will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the state where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
<br></br>

We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.

            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            APPLICABLE LAW
            <br></br>
