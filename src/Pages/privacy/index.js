            Use of your information
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Your information will enable us to provide you with access to
            specific parts of our site and to operate the wazodeal.com service
            for you. We will also use and analyse the information we collect so
            that we can improve and develop our business. In particular, we may
            use your information to contact you for your views on our services
            and to notify you occasionally about important changes or
            developments to the site or our services. Further, we might also use
            your information to let you know about other products and services
            which we offer which may be of interest to you. If you change your
            mind about being contacted in the future, you can opt-out by
            contacting us directly or changing your preferences through your
            account settings. If you contact us, we may keep a record of that
            correspondence. For content that is covered by intellectual property
            rights, such as photos and videos ("Media"), subject to your account
            settings, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable,
            sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license ("Licence") to use
            any Media that you provide in connection with your account for any
            of our commercial or non-commercial purposes including, without
            limitation, in our printed publications, presentations, promotional
            materials, advertising or on our website. This License ends when you
            delete your Media or your account unless your content has been
            shared with others, and they have not deleted it. When you delete
            Media, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin
            on a computer. However, you understand that removed content may
            persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will
            not be available to others).
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Disclosure of your information

            information that can be used to identify you. 
            <br></br>
            
            Confirmation of
            whether you have an account registered with us - by the email
            address you register or verify with - will be publicly available.
            <br></br>

            Unless required to do so by law, we will not otherwise share, sell
            or distribute any of the information you provide to us without your
            consent. 
            <br></br>
            
            Finally, if our business enters into a joint venture with
            or is sold to or merged with another business entity, your
            information may be disclosed to our new business partners or owners.
